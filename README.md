# Chronos - Web Search & Summary Tool

A streamlined web search application that provides comprehensive summaries from multiple sources using DuckDuckGo search results.

## Features

- **Smart Search**: Search the web using DuckDuckGo with up to 50 results

   - Important details highlighted in italics
   - Query terms emphasized with underlines
   - Organized bullet points for easy reading
5. Displays all search results with direct links
